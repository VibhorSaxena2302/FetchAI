uAgents is a library developed by Fetch.ai that allows for creating autonomous AI agents in Python. With simple and expressive decorators, you can have an agent that performs various tasks on a schedule or takes action on various events.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 **Easy creation and management**: Create any type of agent you can think of and put into code.
- 🔗 **Connected**: On startup, each agent automatically joins the fast growing network of uAgents by registering on the Almanac, a smart contract deployed on the Fetch.ai blockchain.
- 🔒 **Secure**: uAgent messages and wallets are cryptographically secured, so their identities and assets are protected.

## ⚡ Quickstart

### Installation

Get started with uAgents by installing it for Python 3.9 to 3.12:

    pip install uagents

### Running a Demo

#### Creating an Agent

Build your first uAgent using the following script:

```python3
from uagents import Agent, Context
alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")
```

Include a seed parameter when creating an agent to set fixed addresses, or leave it out to generate a new random address each time.

#### Giving it a task

Give it a simple task, such as a greeting:

```python3
@alice.on_interval(period=2.0)
async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {ctx.agent.name}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    alice.run()
```

#### Running the Agent

So far, your code should look like this:

```python3
from uagents import Agent, Context

alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

@alice.on_interval(period=2.0)
async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {ctx.agent.name}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    alice.run()
```

Run it using:

```bash
python agent.py
```

You should see the results in your terminal.
